# Backend instance configuration migration

Issue #510 makes a concrete runner/account binding a first-class routing
instance. The shared registry belongs in `~/.config/gah/canonical.toml`
(`PARASAUR_CANONICAL_CONFIG` overrides that path). A repository can add or replace
entries with the same syntax under its defaults or profile routing section.

Precedence is:

1. shared canonical `routing.backend_instances`;
2. repository `[defaults.routing.backend_instances.<name>]`;
3. `[profiles.<profile>.routing.backend_instances.<name>]`.

Maps merge by instance name and then by field. A project can change one field
without copying the other canonical fields. Candidate lists keep their existing
replace-wholesale semantics. Legacy candidates without `instance` continue to
use the existing profile paths, backend aliases, and AGY secondary-home
compatibility behavior.

## Codex and Claude accounts

Use Settings to add a named Codex or Claude account to a profile. GAH shows only the safe account label and auth status.

The equivalent CLI flow is:

```text
gah config add-backend-instance --profile my-repo --instance codex-work --runner-kind codex --account-label work
gah config authenticate-backend-instance --profile my-repo --instance codex-work
gah doctor --profile my-repo --validate
```

The authentication command starts the provider's browser or device flow. GAH does not accept or store the provider password or token.

Each named account gets a separate state directory under the GAH configuration directory.
Use a different instance name for each account. Chat stores the selected instance with the session.

## Shared registry

Declare safe labels, never credentials. `executable` may be a CLI or a wrapper
that selects credentials outside GAH. `state_root` becomes that process's
`HOME` and must not be shared by independent accounts.

To use the service `PATH`, omit `executable` and set `resolve_from_path = true`.
GAH does not fall back to `PATH` unless this policy is explicit.

```toml
[routing.backend_instances.opencode-subscription]
runner_kind = "opencode"
logical_backend = "opencode"
executable = "/opt/gah/bin/opencode-subscription"
state_root = "/var/lib/gah/opencode-subscription"
account_label = "personal-subscription"
auth_source_label = "opencode-login"
quota_pool = "opencode-plan"
supported_models = ["openai/gpt-5"]

[routing.backend_instances.opencode-api]
runner_kind = "opencode"
logical_backend = "opencode"
executable = "/opt/gah/bin/opencode-api"
state_root = "/var/lib/gah/opencode-api"
account_label = "team-api"
auth_source_label = "env-openai-key"
quota_pool = "openai-api"
supported_models = ["openai/gpt-5"]
```

A project selects those bindings without repeating their runtime setup:

```toml
[[profiles.my-repo.routing.improve_candidates]]
backend = "opencode"
instance = "opencode-subscription"
model = "openai/gpt-5"
priority = 100
included_in_quota = true

[[profiles.my-repo.routing.improve_candidates]]
backend = "opencode"
instance = "opencode-api"
model = "openai/gpt-5"
priority = 10
marginal_cost_usd = 1.0
requires_approval = true
```

The two candidates remain separate routing, concurrency, availability, quota,
ledger, and telemetry destinations even though runner, logical backend, and
model are identical. The instance name is the durable destination key.

Skill bindings use the same destination key. An instance binding takes
precedence over its logical backend binding, and a project instance override
takes precedence over both canonical sets. Bindings live in the central skill
bank rather than TOML so chat and autonomous dispatch resolve the same
versioned skill set.

A local backend uses the same schema and no billing classification:

```toml
[routing.backend_instances.local-ollama]
runner_kind = "opencode"
logical_backend = "opencode"
executable = "/usr/local/bin/opencode"
state_root = "/var/lib/gah/local-opencode"
account_label = "local-ollama"
auth_source_label = "local-runtime"
supported_models = ["ollama/qwen3-coder"]

[[routing.improve_candidates]]
backend = "opencode"
instance = "local-ollama"
model = "ollama/qwen3-coder"
priority = 100
```

## Project override

To override one global binding for one repository, redeclare that same key in
the repository config. Specify only the fields that change:

```toml
[profiles.my-repo.routing.backend_instances.opencode-subscription]
executable = "/workspace/my-repo/bin/opencode-wrapper"
state_root = "/workspace/my-repo/.gah/opencode-home"
```

`gah config show` and `gah status --json` report whether the executable
resolved, its resolution source, the configuration layer, and the exact safe
failure. Executable and state-root paths are runtime-only. Credentials are
never accepted as identity labels.

## Validation and rollback

Run:

```text
gah doctor --profile my-repo --validate
gah config show --profile my-repo --json
gah status --profile my-repo --json
```

Approve an instance-scoped paid fallback with the exact destination printed by
the routing error:

```text
gah route-approval grant --profile my-repo ISSUE-42 --backend opencode \
  --instance opencode-api --model openai/gpt-5
```

Doctor rejects unknown instance references, missing/non-executable bindings,
unsafe labels, shared state roots, model/instance mismatches, and contradictory
cost declarations. To roll back, remove `instance` from candidates and remove
the registry entries; legacy backend paths and routing remain compatible. No
ledger, availability, quota, or telemetry rewrite is required.
