# Windows desktop and WSL worker

The native Tauri desktop manages a central Parasaur node. The headless worker runs inside WSL2.
The desktop lists Windows and WSL tools separately. A listed executable does not prove authentication or dispatch compatibility.

For an external test, use the [Windows tester guide](WINDOWS_TESTER_GUIDE.md).
It starts with a matching Actions bundle and omits maintainer-only build steps.

Release 0.1.2 and later contain matching desktop and worker files.
Use a matching Actions bundle only to test an unpublished revision.

## Install from the central dashboard

1. Open Settings → General → Add a Node.
2. Enter the central node's LAN or VPN address.
3. Select the desktop, the worker, or both.
4. For direct LAN access, enter the central access token.
5. Reveal the Windows install command.
6. For worker installation, open PowerShell as administrator with your normal Windows account.
7. Paste the command.

The desktop installer runs silently. Open **GAH Worker** from the Start menu.
The connection screen remains available when the central node cannot load.

Worker setup requires x64 Windows and an initialized, non-root Ubuntu user in WSL2.
If WSL needs installation or a restart, the command stops with instructions. Complete those steps, then run the command again.

The central server needs these settings:

- `COORDINATOR_TOKEN` for authenticated access.
- `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or a working `gh auth login` for private release downloads.
- `GAH_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP=1` for the current worker enrollment transport on a trusted LAN or VPN.
- Its Git checkout, including these committed installer changes.

The command contains the central access token. Use it only on a trusted worker computer.
The worker does not receive the central server's GitHub credential.

Parasaur does not have account sign-in. The central token grants owner access.
Device pairing grants dashboard control, but it does not grant update or administration access.
If an update requires owner access, reconnect with the central token from a trusted computer.

The worker uses port 3774. Windows forwards that port to WSL and restricts its firewall rule to the central node.
Use a stable Windows LAN or VPN address. If that address changes, run setup again.

The `GAH WSL Worker` task starts at Windows logon. It refreshes WSL forwarding and keeps the distribution active.
The `gah-worker.service` user service owns the worker process. Closing the desktop leaves this service running.
This installation does not start before Windows logon.

Microsoft documents the relevant [WSL networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/networking) and [systemd behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/systemd).

## Finish worker readiness

A new installation has no repository profiles. An upgrade keeps and registers the existing profiles.
The installer does not change GitHub, GitLab, Claude, or Codex authentication.

1. Open Ubuntu as the same WSL user.
2. Install and authenticate the backend that you want to use.
3. For GitHub repositories, install and authenticate `gh`.
4. For GitLab repositories, install and authenticate `glab`.
5. Clone the repository into the WSL filesystem.
6. Add its profile with `gah profile add`.
7. Register its profile name with the command below.
8. Check profile readiness before dispatching work.

The private worker environment adds the installed Parasaur binary to the shell's path:

```bash
source ~/.local/share/gah/worker/worker.env
gah profile add --help
~/.local/share/gah/worker/register.sh PROFILE_NAME
gah doctor --profile PROFILE_NAME
```

Use these commands to inspect the common authentication state:

```bash
gh auth status
claude auth status
command -v codex
```

If `command -v codex` has no output, install Codex inside WSL before you select it.
Install the repository toolchain too. For this repository, install Rust so that `cargo` is available.

Use the same profile name as the central node. To register several profiles, supply comma-separated names.
A Claude-only node is valid. Other agent CLIs are optional.

Native Windows CLI dispatch is not implemented by this change. Windows executable discovery is informational.
The current worker executes agents inside WSL. Native execution needs separate process, filesystem, and cancellation tests.

## Test without publishing a release

The Desktop workflow can build a matching Windows installer and Linux worker bundle from one revision.
Its Linux job runs only for a manual workflow dispatch. It uploads Actions artifacts and does not publish a release.

After the tested branch is available on GitHub, dispatch it and record the successful run ID and commit:

```sh
gh workflow run desktop.yml --ref BRANCH -R Kh1ng/git-agent-harness
gh run list --workflow desktop.yml --event workflow_dispatch --limit 5 -R Kh1ng/git-agent-harness
gh run watch RUN_ID --exit-status -R Kh1ng/git-agent-harness
gh run view RUN_ID --json headSha -R Kh1ng/git-agent-harness
```

Deploy that revision on central before the worker acceptance test. The local bundle does not update central.
On Windows, use authenticated `gh` downloads from the same successful run. In PowerShell:

```powershell
$run = 'RUN_ID'
$root = Join-Path $env:TEMP "gah-test-$run"
gh run download $run -R Kh1ng/git-agent-harness -n gah-worker-windows-nsis -D "$root\desktop"
gh run download $run -R Kh1ng/git-agent-harness -n gah-worker-linux-test -D "$root\worker"
$bundle = Join-Path $root 'bundle'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $bundle -Force | Out-Null
Copy-Item "$root\desktop\*" $bundle
Copy-Item "$root\worker\*" $bundle -Force
```

Open PowerShell as administrator with your normal Windows account. Set the central URL and read its token without echoing it:

```powershell
$central = 'http://CENTRAL_LAN_IP:3773'
$secret = Read-Host 'Central access token' -AsSecureString
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('gah', $secret)
$token = $credential.GetNetworkCredential().Password
& "$bundle\install-windows.ps1" -TestArtifactDirectory $bundle -CentralUrl $central -CoordinatorToken $token -Role both
Remove-Variable token, credential, secret
```

Set `$bundle` again in the elevated shell if it did not inherit your earlier variables.
Use `-Role worker` for headless-only testing. Desktop-only testing needs only the desktop artifact and accepts `-Role desktop`.

The installer verifies both revision manifests, all file hashes, and its own script before it installs anything.
Mixed revisions, missing files, changed files, and a script from another bundle fail validation.
Checksums establish bundle consistency; they are not publisher signatures. Download through authenticated GitHub access.

This option replaces release downloads with verified local files. The same installer still configures WSL, forwarding, the firewall, and the logon task.
It registers the worker with central. Complete the readiness and acceptance steps below.
This test does not prove the online release-download path. Run the normal Add a Node command after a matching release is approved.

## Windows acceptance test

Use a disposable repository for dispatch tests. Record the installer filename, Windows version, WSL version, and selected distribution.

1. Build or download the NSIS installer and matching worker test bundle from the accepted revision.
2. Install it on Windows without an existing Parasaur desktop configuration.
3. Open the app from the Start menu.
4. Check that one app window opens without a console window.
5. Enter the central address and open the dashboard.
6. Open **Settings → This computer**. Enter an unreachable address, then use the app menu’s **Settings** action to restore the correct address.
7. Install the worker through Add a Node.
8. Check its registry identity and declared profiles on the central node.
9. Authenticate Claude inside WSL and configure one repository profile.
10. Dispatch one bounded task to that node.
11. Check logs, terminal output, cancellation, and resulting repository changes.
12. Close the desktop and check that the worker remains reachable.
13. Restart Windows and log on.
14. Check worker reachability and the refreshed WSL forwarding address.
15. Run setup again and check that the node identity remains unchanged.

Also test missing WSL, WSL1, an uninitialized Linux user, missing systemd, rejected credentials, and unavailable release assets.
Check that each failure stops setup without claiming readiness.

## Local checks

```bash
npm run build:contracts
npm run build:shared
npm run --workspace=apps/server typecheck
npm run --workspace=apps/web typecheck
npm run --workspace=apps/desktop typecheck
npm exec tsx -- --test apps/server/src/nodeSetup.test.ts apps/server/src/fleetDispatch.test.ts
cargo test --test installer_scripts
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/test-windows-installer.ps1
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo test --manifest-path apps/desktop/Cargo.toml --bin gah-desktop -- --test-threads=1
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=1 cargo clippy --manifest-path apps/desktop/Cargo.toml --bin gah-desktop -- -D warnings
```

## Evidence

The macOS checks passed: desktop Rust test, desktop Clippy, three workspace typechecks, and both frontend builds.
Twelve focused server tests passed. These cover installer selection, command validation, and authenticated fleet dispatch and reconciliation.
The PowerShell parser checked the installer and its embedded task script. The WSL configuration test checked quoting, credential permissions, and stable identity.
A Chromium smoke test checked the desktop form, separate tool environments, visible errors, and horizontal overflow with a mocked native bridge.

On 2026-09-23, a physical Windows host installed the 0.1.2 worker bundle.
The worker kept its node ID and `gah` profile after the upgrade.
The central node reached the worker through Tailscale and read its Claude model catalog.
The worker health endpoint reported version 0.1.2.

Windows restart recovery still needs a separate test after the 0.1.2 release install.
Native Windows agent execution remains outside this setup. Agents run inside WSL.

## Installer checks

`node scripts/test-node-test-artifacts.mjs` verifies revision and checksum manifests,
tracked source export, and rejection of ambiguous installers or stale output directories.
Windows CI runs `scripts/test-windows-installer.ps1` against malformed and mixed bundles.

`cargo test --test installer_scripts` runs the Linux, macOS, and WSL shell installers
against the built `gah` in a scratch home. Strict command substitutes verify setup order,
private credentials, and LaunchAgent contents, and prohibit privileged or central setup on
workers. This does not prove a Cargo installation or service startup.
