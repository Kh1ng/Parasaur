# iPhone control testing

## Scope

The native tests use a local fixture without a coding provider. They cover address validation, saved URLs without pairing secrets, persistent cookies, and failed-connection recovery. Scanner tests cover requests from Settings, rejected requests from other pages and iframes, and drafts after cancellation. Physical camera behavior and network changes require an iPhone.

The web changes cover phone touch targets, safe areas, session controls, and URL-based project/chat restoration. Browser emulation and simulator results do not prove physical keyboard behavior, camera scanning, cellular reconnection, or node control on an iPhone.

The owner requested an installable iPhone app. The SwiftUI shell adds a persistent app login, native QR scanner, connection recovery, and reviewed app links while reusing the central web dashboard. It does not fix WebSocket/network behavior by itself. Physical Safari and native network tests remain necessary before closing issue #936. Android packaging remains separate.

## Prepare

1. Connect the iPhone to the Mac and unlock it. Accept Trust This Computer if requested.
2. Sign into Xcode under Settings > Accounts. Select your development team for the `GAH` target.
3. Enable Developer Mode under iPhone Settings > Privacy & Security if needed.
4. Build and run `apps/ios/GAH.xcodeproj` on the iPhone. A dashboard refresh cannot update the native scanner integration.
5. Turn on Tailscale. Use your configured central HTTPS origin, including its port if required.

## Repeatable physical navigation check

After pairing the app, run this read-only smoke test from the Mac:

```sh
GAH_IOS_DEVICE=YOUR_IPHONE_UDID \
GAH_IOS_TEAM=YOUR_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM \
GAH_IOS_CENTRAL_URL=https://central.example.ts.net:8443 \
GAH_IOS_EXPECTED_NODE=YOUR_WORKER_NAME \
bash scripts/test-ios-central.sh
```

It builds and installs the current app, then opens Nodes, Chat, Git, Telemetry, and Settings through the existing paired session.
It also checks Settings after backgrounding and a process restart. It exports screenshots and the XCTest result bundle to a temporary evidence directory.
It sends no coding turn, worker command, or device revocation. Missing authentication fails the test.
The simulator suite skips this check unless explicitly configured. Camera, keyboard, cellular handoff, and Live Activity acceptance still require the steps below.

## Acceptance run

Record a pass or the exact failure for each step. Do not count an untested step as a pass.

1. In the owner dashboard, open **Settings > Connection & pairing** and generate a new QR code. In Parasaur, open **Settings > Connection & pairing > Scan pairing QR code**. Confirm that no separate globe button appears above the dashboard. Scan the code, confirm the server identity, and name this device. If central cannot load, use **Connection settings** in the error message. If the app has no saved address, use **Set up connection**.
2. Close and reopen Parasaur. Confirm it remains paired. Open Nodes and check your expected Windows worker.
3. Open Chat. Select the Parasaur project and the existing Windows worker acceptance conversation. Confirm earlier messages load and the selected execution node is Windows.
4. Open a new test chat on Windows using Claude. Send: `Read-only mobile check: print GAH_IPHONE_OK and the current working directory. Do not edit files or run builds.` Confirm the reply appears on both phone and desktop. Record the node, conversation ID, and result.
5. Start another harmless read-only turn. Confirm streaming works and Stop remains reachable with the keyboard open. Stop once, and verify central reports the turn has stopped.
6. Type an unsent draft. Rotate the phone both ways, lock and unlock it, and switch apps. Confirm the draft and selected chat remain.
7. While a conversation is open, turn Wi-Fi off and use cellular with Tailscale enabled. Confirm the disconnected state is honest, the connection recovers, and history has no duplicated or missing completed replies. Repeat from cellular to Wi-Fi.
8. Force-quit and reopen Parasaur. Confirm the same project/chat and completed history return. Unsent draft recovery after process termination is not promised.
9. Open Git, Work, Telemetry, and Settings. Confirm scrolling works, controls remain reachable, and error text fits in portrait and landscape. Inspect Git only; do not create commits for this check.
10. Use a second available node for a separate read-only chat. Confirm node labels distinguish the execution locations. Do not treat existing node switching as committed-file transfer; that handoff feature is still pending.
11. Increase iPhone text size and enable VoiceOver. Confirm that Settings, the scanner, the recovery form, and dashboard navigation remain accessible. Confirm no required control is hidden behind the keyboard or home indicator.
12. Revoke this phone in the owner dashboard. Confirm HTTP and WebSocket access stop. Open **Settings > Connection & pairing** while signed out. Pair again with a new one-use code.
13. Type an unsent draft, open Settings, start the scanner, and cancel. Return to Chat and confirm that the draft remains. Deny camera access and confirm that the scanner explains the pairing-link fallback.
14. Scan a valid code for a different central address. Cancel the address confirmation and confirm that the current dashboard remains. Repeat and accept the address, then confirm that the new server still requires pairing confirmation.
15. Turn off Tailscale, then force-quit and reopen Parasaur. Confirm that the connection error exposes **Connection settings**. Restore Tailscale and use **Retry connection**. Confirm that the saved device session remains.

Repeat steps 3, 6, 7, and 9 in Safari to distinguish web defects from native-shell defects. Safari requires its own pairing session. Native camera scanning and Wi-Fi/cellular changes require the physical phone.
