//! Alert-only health check for `gah-loop@<profile>.service` systemd units.
//!
//! Issue #726: a previous host-local, untracked script silently restarted a
//! stopped loop by calling the dashboard's start endpoint, which resumed
//! concurrent work during a blocker repair and violated
//! `gah-loop@.service`'s own contract (`Restart=no` -- the operator/
//! dashboard starts work explicitly, nothing else may).
//!
//! This module is read-only by construction: the only external command it
//! ever runs is `systemctl --user show <unit> --property=... --value`, a
//! query that cannot mutate unit state. It never calls `systemctl
//! start`/`restart`/`enable`, `gah loop`, or any HTTP endpoint -- there is
//! no code path here capable of starting a loop, not just a policy choice
//! not to.
