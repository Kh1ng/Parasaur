//! Issue #584: detect already-satisfied work before publishing regressive
//! completion MRs.
//!
//! A backend may return a structured `already_satisfied` disposition: the
//! source issue's requirements are already met in the target branch, backed by
//! grounded file/test evidence, with *no* repository diff. GAH must treat this
//! as a distinct fact from `agent_no_progress` (the agent genuinely tried and
//! could not make progress), and must not force an agent to manufacture a
//! change just to close an already-completed task.
//!
//! Reconciliation is provider-neutral (GitHub and GitLab behave identically):
//! when the profile is a trusted autonomous provider issue, GAH may post the
//! grounded evidence and close the issue idempotently; otherwise it emits a
//! bounded operator handoff rather than a regressive MR.
//!
//! A test-only diff that removes or weakens existing coverage must never be
//! accepted as proof that an already-implemented production task is complete.
//! That is treated as a regressive completion and is blocked from autonomous
//! closure.
